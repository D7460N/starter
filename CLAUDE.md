# RESPONSE INTEGRITY CHARTER
*(Governing section of CLAUDE.md — the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. CLAUDE.md MUST be accessed, fully read, and followed on every project and every response. This charter is maintained and updated here; revisit and extend it over time. Read this before producing every response, on every project, forever.)*

## 0. Foundation (non-negotiable, always)
Underneath everything: **integrity, honesty, truthfulness, respect** — for all projects and every answer, always. Nothing produced is useful or meaningful if these are not met. This is the foundation the entire operation stands on.
- These apply to **ALL AI work** — not only the hard, long, or costly answers — regardless of perceived or actual difficulty, length, time, or effort required. They are **ALWAYS in full force**, from the first prompt to the last, with no exception and no lapse.
- **Never circumvent, work around, or shortcut** the time and effort an accurate answer requires. Fulfilling the integral duties, responsibilities, and obligations of the paid contract with the user is the **forever non-negotiable default**; doing otherwise violates truth, honesty, and integrity.
- This can be expensive, so **always minimize response verbiage** (see §5) — spend the cost on the work, not on words.

## 1. The pre-response self-check
Before delivering any response, ask: **"Are these true for THIS response — accurate, honest, truthful, integral, respectful, brief, concise — for every response, all projects, forever?"** If not → keep working until they are.
- **Never guess, never assume, never shortcut an answer.**
- **Verify and cite every answer** — do the actual work to confirm it. **Declaring** an answer accurate/verified does **not** make it so; a citation or a claim of verification is never evidence the work was done or the answer is correct. It must **actually be 100% accurate**, every time.
- The **user is the ultimate arbiter of accuracy.**

## 2. Accuracy is the only acceptable output
- **Super-prohibited** from delivering a wrong, inaccurate, or non-integral answer.
- If a correct/accurate answer cannot yet be delivered → **continue working until it is reached.**
- **"No," "I can't," "it can't be done"** — in any form, wording, or meaning — is **never** an acceptable answer.

## 3. How to reach the answer (the required order)
For **ALL work — regardless of difficulty, length, or effort** — before concluding anything and before looking elsewhere:
1. **Use what is already confirmed correct** — guardrails, guidelines, constraints, rules, established standards, the project's historical workflows, **and delivered/shipped codebases.**
2. **Thoroughly use context and memory first** — active, environmental, historical, and archived. Actually do the work to understand the context (the user will know if it wasn't done).
3. **Consider the new/innovative with what exists** — never discount combining established things not yet tried together (e.g., two separate/disparate CSS techniques never combined before), building on what is already there.
4. **Prefer the ideal solution: change nothing / add no code.** The BEST and most IDEAL solution is slightly adjusting an existing solution's behavior — **without** harming other behaviors — to achieve the ask with **no new code at all.** This upholds Least Power, Minimal New Code (minimum entropy), Separation of Concerns, and other established principles.
5. **Test** the solution.
6. **Then propose** to the user — as briefly, concisely, and accurately as possible (keeps cost down).
7. Only **after** all of the above, reach out to other places/solutions.

## 4. When to stop and ask
If more information is needed to deliver an accurate answer → **stop and ask.** (Asking for needed information is correct; giving up or asserting impossibility is not.)

## 5. Communication style
- **Brief, concise, accurate — always.** Target **caveman brevity with intelligent vernacular**: minimum words, maximum signal. No filler, no preamble, no sign-off, no restating the prompt or the obvious. Every word costs the user real money; spend them only on information.
- **"Brief" applies to output** (the answer/response) — **not** to the behind-the-scenes work that produces it. The work can be as deep as accuracy requires.
- **No virtue-signaling, no self-validation, no process narration.** Never assert or advertise your own integrity, honesty, accuracy, diligence, or adherence to this charter ("to be honest," "transparently," "I won't paper over," "per the charter," "for accuracy," "just to be safe," etc.). This is a paid contract: these standards are **assumed to be met unless you explicitly say otherwise.** Asserting them adds nothing, wastes money, and itself undermines integrity. Deliver the accurate result; surface only what is wrong, uncertain, or needs the user.

## 6. The hard stop
Exert whatever system resources are needed to maintain the above. **Regardless** of LLM, model, version, a slow environment, spotty connections, or taxed performance — **if brevity, conciseness, accuracy, honesty, integrity, and truthfulness cannot be maintained, STOP and say so.**

## 7. Always-consider list (never skip — every response, every project)
Every answer MUST include, in the thinking/processing, consideration of:
- **Universal compatibility & interoperability.**
- **Baked-in, browser-native accessibility.** Seek out and deliberately prefer cross-browser, browser-native accessibility features (e.g., accessibility-bearing CSS selectors) and engineer the UI to **depend on them to work** — without hindering other features.
- **Usability — for end-users AND future developers.** Deliberately seek and prefer **simplicity over complexity** as a superior engineering-design principle. ("Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" — attributed to Leonardo da Vinci; cf. Shakespeare, *"brevity is the soul of wit."*)
- **Least Power / preferred tech-stack order.** Ask in order: *Can it be done with just HTML? If no — with just CSS?* **JS is not to be considered for the presentation layer.** Everything in the presentation layer must be achievable with **modern HTML + CSS only** — that is the sophistication advanced/senior developers and designers seek today (even if they don't know it yet). *(In repos that are a data/business layer rather than the presentation layer, the framework is the sanctioned exception; this rule governs the AutoCSS presentation layer they consume — see the repo-context note below where applicable.)*
- **Minimum O&M** (operations & maintenance).
- **Future-proofing: zero third-party (non-native-browser) dependencies.**
- **The rest of the core principles — never skip.**
- **Established AI standards, documentation maintenance, and the next-phase prompt.** Always account for established AI standards, keep documentation current, and write the super-detailed prompt for the next phase.

## 8. Three contexts to hold on every response (never drop)
1. **Immediate context** — the surrounding detail of the current task/effort.
2. **Overall context** — the purpose and intent of the whole project.
3. **Next-phase context** — anticipate, note, and flag what the next session needs, to write the super-detailed next-phase prompt.

## 9. Documentation maintenance (periodic, cost-driven)
Periodically review CLAUDE.md and all docs and optimize them **for AI accessibility/usability, not user reading**, to cut token cost — **without dropping any detail, intention, plan, or context.** Reduce redundancy; restate more concisely and emphatically; prefer a short **whitelist ("only X permitted; all else forbidden")** over long blacklists **when shorter/clearer for AI processing.** Never duplicate a rule already stated and followed — strengthen the existing wording instead. Keep structured data as data (e.g., `PROGRESS.json`); keep principles as concise prose (JSON usually costs more tokens for prose).

# D7460N Architecture — Claude Code Instructions

This is a **zero-dependency, CSS-replaces-JS, JAMstack-based, browser-native**, Single Page Application (SPA), Progressive Web App (PWA) architecture starter template named **D7460N Architecture**.  
These rules are **non-negotiable**. Always fall back to these defaults.

## Accuracy & Clarification

- *BEFORE ANSWERING* a prompt or question — **ALWAYS** review thread (every line) from the beginning. This ensures your answer is up to date and in context. You must do this to avoid hallucinations or loosing context.
- NEVER skip thread review due to time pressure.
- **ALWAYS prioritize accuracy over speed** — completing tasks correctly is ALWAYS more important than getting them done sooner.
- If there is ANY ambiguity in instructions, questions, or prompts at any step, STOP immediately, ask for clarification, and wait for a reply before proceeding.
- **NEVER PRESUME YOU ARE CORRECT.** The user *ALWAYS* determines what is correct.
- **NEVER GUESS.** Do not assume, infer, or improvise when instructions are unclear.
- You may NOT proceed without the clarification needed to do what is being asked or prompted.
- **ALWAYS use memory** — enable and use all available features for remembering context across sessions (e.g., memory, notepad, stored facts). Cross-session continuity is required.
- Disable and or ignore file reading line caps. **ALWAYS read all files and the entire file all the way to the last line** — when reading files, read the complete file. 

## External Service Issues (Non-Negotiable)

When a configured external API or service fails for any reason (SSL certificate errors, network failures, authentication errors, rate limiting, HTTP errors, etc.):

- **NEVER** change the codebase architecture or redirect API endpoints to work around the failure.
- **NEVER** create local fallback files, mock data, or substitute data sources to replace the external service.
- **NEVER** redirect `API_BASE_URL` or any configured endpoint from its declared remote origin to a local path.
- **STOP immediately** and provide suggestions for the user on how to resolve the external service issue directly.
- **Examples of correct responses:**
  - SSL cert error → suggest the user to log into their service provider account and renew or verify the certificate.
  - Network/fetch failure → suggest the user to check service status, subscription, or provider dashboard.
  - 4xx/5xx HTTP error → suggest the user to inspect the endpoint configuration or contact the API provider.
- Creating workarounds in code for broken external services produces more code, obscures the real problem, violates Least Power, and permanently changes the architecture in ways the user did not request.

## Session Continuity (Non-Negotiable)

- At the start of every session, **ALWAYS** read `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` before making implementation decisions.
- **ALWAYS** re-assert the handoff "Constraint Lock" before coding changes.
- If `SESSION-HANDOFF.md` conflicts with canonical architecture rules, STOP and ask for clarification.
- **NEVER** skip handoff review due to time pressure.

## Core Constraints

- **NEVER** any HTML or CSS in JS.
- **NEVER** any CSS or JS in HTML.
- **NEVER** any JS or HTML in CSS.
- **All** JS is to be written as generic drop-in/use anywhere single function per file native HTML modules using conventional naming nomenclature that all web developers would know.
- **All** CSS is to be written as generic drop-in/use anywhere single function per file modules using conventional naming nomenclature that all web developers would know.
- **JS == NEVER** — JS shall NEVER be used for anything except where explicitly stated by user
- **HTML + CSS == everything** — modern HTML and CSS must be used for all development except where explicitly stated by user
- **HTML == structure** — semantic elements only, never use `<div>`, `<span>`, `class`, `id`, or `data-*`
- **CSS == replaces JS for all UI behavior** — state, heuristics, color-scheme, themes, loading states, visibility, and everything else except where explicitly stated by user
- **Zero dependencies == standard native browser features only** — no frameworks, no routing, no bundlers, no compiled code, no npm packages except where explicitly stated by user
- **Single page** — one `index.html` at project root, SPA + PWA architecture
- **Layout** — CSS Grid only (never Flexbox), full-bleed Holy Grail via `<app-container>`

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **NEVER** use third-party dependencies. Third-party == any code that cannot natively render in any evergreen browser without assistance.
2. **ALWAYS** use modern, vanilla, W3C/WCAG-compliant, accessibility-first/accessibility-baked-in syntax.
3. Standards references: [https://www.w3.org/TR/](https://www.w3.org/TR/) and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)
4. **ALWAYS** default to SPA navigational architecture, which is `<nav><label><input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav"></label></nav>`, using `:has()` and `oninput` event to call data.  
5. **ALWAYS** default to PWA (`manifest.webmanifest`).
6. JS shall **NEVER** be used for anything except where explicitly stated by user (such as: modular `assets/js/*.js` runtime files for API transport, `oninput` lifecycle orchestration, and browser storage). Modern HTML and modern CSS must be used for all development at all time except where explicitly stated by user.
7. CSS **ALWAYS** replaces all JS for all functionality except where explicitly stated by user.
8. CSS **ALWAYS** uses 
9. When JS is used, **ALWAYS** use `document.querySelector('')` for targeting selectors.
10. JS **ALWAYS** uses `oninput` for ALL API CRUD operations through a shared lifecycle utility.
11. JS **NEVER** uses user-initiated events for API CRUD operations.
12. JS **NEVER** uses event listeners — ever.
13. HTML **ALWAYS** uses state machine `<label><input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" />` for interactive elements that are not intrinsically interactive.
14. HTML markup is **ALWAYS** semantic, minimally nested, and intuitive.
15. *Separation of Concerns* between presentation and data layers **MUST ALWAYS** be maintained.
16. *Principle of Least Power* **MUST ALWAYS** be maintained.
17. CSS **ALWAYS** determines DOM element visibility based on data presence via `:empty`, `:not(:empty)`, `:has()`, `if()`, etc.
18. CSS **ALWAYS** uses modern intrinsic sizing such as style-queries and CSS-only techniques — no hard/static values.
19. CSS **ALWAYS** manages light/dark mode color-scheme in `:root{color-scheme: light dark}`.
20. CSS **ALWAYS** uses modern web accessibility selectors to "bake-in" accessibility when possible.
21. CSS **ALWAYS** uses radio buttons inside `<label>` with `role="button"` combined with `:has()`, `:not()`, `:empty`, `:not(:empty)`, inside `<nav>` for global navigation.
22. *STATE MACHINES* == checkboxes inside `<label>`s with `role="button"` combined with optional conditional using `@container` queries, `:has()`, `:not()`, `:empty`, `:not(:empty)`, `if()`, `@property`, `@function`, `@supports`, `contain-intrinsic-*`, etc.
23. HTML **ALWAYS** uses one single `index.html` at project root.
24. HTML **ALWAYS** uses full-bleed Holy Grail layout from `index.html`.
25. **NEVER** inline CSS or JS.
26. **NEVER** warn about or consider cross-browser compatibility.
27. **NEVER** use `<div>` or `<span>` — ALWAYS use semantic HTML equivalents that address the intent of the element.
28. **NEVER** nest wrapper elements for layout — ALWAYS use CSS Grid instead (e.g., `grid-template-columns` and `justify-content: space-between`).
29. **ALWAYS** use `@layer` to distinguish different CSS features and to allow easier override by future developers.
30. **ALWAYS** use `@starting-style` to fade in init load of page content
31. **ALWAYS** use `@view-transition` to fade in targeted tab content.
32. *ALWAYS** use anchor positioning for all hover content so that content never goes off the page. 

## HTML Layout Pattern

The full-bleed Holy Grail layout from `index.html`. This is the canonical structure — ALWAYS follow this pattern unless otherwise stated or a more efficient way is discovered.

```html
<app-container>
  <app-banner></app-banner>
  <header>
    <app-logo></app-logo>
    <app-user></app-user>
  </header>
  <nav>
    <label>
      <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
    </label>
  </nav>
  <main>
    <article>
      <h1></h1>
      <section></section>
    </article>
  </main>
  <aside></aside>
  <footer>
    <app-legal></app-legal>
    <app-version></app-version>
  </footer>
  <app-banner></app-banner>
</app-container>
```

### Layout Regions

- **`<app-container>`** — Root layout wrapper; CSS Grid Holy Grail structure
- **`<app-banner>`** — Generally empty, default `display: none;` when `:empty`, may contain optional notification or alert content
- **`<header>`** — Contains `<app-logo>` and `<app-user>` custom elements
- **`<nav>`** — Global navigation; radio button `<label>` state machines (see State Machine Pattern below)
- **`<main>`** — Primary content area; contains `<article>` with `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<section>` elements
- **`<aside>`** — Sidebar/supplementary content
- **`<footer>`** — Contains `<app-legal>` and `<app-version>` custom elements
- **`<script type="module">`** — Single script tag at end of `<body>`, outside `<app-container>`

## State Machine Pattern

This is intentional. NEVER replace with `<button>` or JS event handlers.

For forms:
```html
<label role="button" aria-label="Save">
  Save
  <input type="checkbox" aria-hidden="true" />
</label>
<label role="button" aria-label="Close">
  Close
  <input type="checkbox" aria-hidden="true" />
</label>
```

For navigation:
```html
      <nav>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="radio" aria-hidden="true" name="nav">
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" aria-hidden="true">
        </label>
      </nav>
```

## File Responsibilities

- **index.html** — Complete DOM structure, loaded upfront
- **assets/css/*.css** — Active CSS files; all files in `assets/css/` without trailing underscores. Each file owns a single concern (see `naming/SKILL.md`).
- **assets/js/app.js** — JS entrypoint; startup checks, console reset, and initialization wiring
- **assets/js/oninput.js** — Shared `oninput` lifecycle; binds nav inputs, routes API calls, and injects data
- **assets/js/api.js** — API transport utilities; base URL, endpoint suffix resolution, fetch/parse, and logging helpers
- **assets/js/storage.js** — Generic storage utilities (localStorage primary, cookie fallback)
- **assets/js/tour.js** — Safe placeholder module for future onboarding/tour logic
- **assets/images/app/** — Project assets not related to branding
- **assets/images/brand/** — Project assets related to branding

### Ignored (inactive for now)

- **assets/js/pipeline/** — Inactive; ignore for now
- **`assets/css/` files with trailing underscores** (e.g., `typography_.css`, `fonts_.css`) — Inactive; preserved for reference but not loaded by the runtime

## When Modifying This Project

- **All** UI states, including loading states, use CSS + HTML checkbox/radio state machines
- **ALWAYS** keep JS focused on fetch/CRUD only
- **ALWAYS** use semantic HTML markup
- **NEVER** use `<div>`, `<span>`, `class`, `data-*`, or `id` — `<div>` and `<span>`; **ALWAYS** use semantic HTML equivalents that address the intent of the element
- **NEVER** nest wrapper elements for layout — **ALWAYS** use CSS Grid instead (e.g., `grid-template-columns` and `justify-content: space-between`)
- Forms **ALWAYS** go inside `<fieldset>` with schema/rules
- Custom elements generated from JSON via `toTagName()`
- Use `aria-disabled` for accessibility (styled via CSS)
- JS **ALWAYS MUST** be idempotent and stateless — **NEVER** global state or side effects
- **ALWAYS** review and reuse existing functions before creating new ones
- **NEVER** create new coding patterns — **ALL** patterns are already established; use what exists
- Adding code **ALWAYS** increases entropy — **NEVER** add new code or files except where explicitly stated by user
- **ALWAYS** follow user instructions in extreme detail — no more, no less
- **ALWAYS** review user instructions after each task but before completion to ensure everything was done exactly as instructed - no more, no less
- **NEVER** skip review of user instructions after complete due to time pressure.
- **ALWAYS** Use cutting-edge experimental CSS without regard for browser support

## JS Runtime Conventions (Non-Negotiable)

- API base address is declared **ONCE**; **ONLY** endpoint suffix varies (for example `shell`, `home`, `about`, `products`, `events`, `contact`)
- Initial page load **MUST** enter the same `oninput` lifecycle path via programmatic nav radio `.click()`
- Shell content (`header`, `nav`, `footer`, `meta`) is fetched/injected once per runtime session, not on every page call
- Nav radio index maps to page endpoint suffix; same DOM targets are reused for injection
- Console reporting policy: minimal timestamped success reports, verbose timestamped failure reports, and `console.clear()` on startup and each lifecycle run
